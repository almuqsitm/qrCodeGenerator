# QR Code Generator 

## Overview

This is a very simple python code that generates a QR code for a link or search. Currently, running it will generate a QR code for my Github and uncommenting the second to last line will allow the user to download the QR code as an .png file. This is a work in progress and there will be a GUI in the future to customize QR code.

## Next Steps
- Input field to take in the link that a user wants
- checkbox to give the option to download as a .png file and/or open a QR code for the given link

## Getting Started

To run this locally, you can first clone this repository and do all necessary commands.

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```
